# Netflix Rewind 1 sec
_A Firefox extension that allows you to rewind the video for 1 second each time you press the < key._


- Use <kbd><</kbd> or <kbd>,</kbd> to rewind with 1 second
- Use <kbd>></kbd> or <kbd>.</kbd> to skip with 5 seconds _(does get stuck sometimes, idk why, maybe because of buffer/stream?)_

## Development
_I made this extension because it annoys me that the default is 10 seconds._

Please feel free to contribute by sending a Pull Request.

### Running the extension
`web-ext run`

### Building
`web-ext build`

## Reference

See https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/ for information about the `web-ext` command.
